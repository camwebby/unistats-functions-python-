# unistats-functions-python-

main contains several functions one can use to pull data from the unistats site. 

The CSV files contain data regarding salaries of courses alongside some other descriptive information.

Secondary is a test file

TariffSalaryDataWriteFile.py pulls data from the API and appends it in one large CSV

CSVReader reads from the large data set and creates the small, specific CSV files. 

I reccomend visiting http://dataportal.unistats.ac.uk/Pages/ApiDocumentation for more information.
